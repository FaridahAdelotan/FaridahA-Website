        <div class="subheading mb-5">Lawyer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Growing up in two different countries – Nigeria and the US – with completely different cultures, values and, to an extent, behaviors, have opened my mind and broadened my knowledge of people and taught me how to live and act in a diverse community.My values, beliefs and experiences have shaped me into the person that I am today, but what makes me stand out are the things I’ve learned based on those experiences and how open I am to continue learning. I am very friendly, hardworking, and I am always willing to try new things as long as they are safe and helpful to my future self.<br><br>

        My hobbies are singing, reading, and dancing.I moved to the United States from Nigeria three years ago and in Nigeria I went to a school called Juilliard Academy from the seventh to the tenth grade and when I moved here, I went to  Academy for Academic Excellence for my eleventh and twelfth grade. While I was in highschool  I volunteered with a children's program at my church and I helped teach Sunday school. I was also active in volunteering my time at Academy for Academic excellence. I volunteered over 40 hours on campus to help raise money to support the High Desert Domestic Violence shelter and the Victor Valley Humane Society. I also served as the Secretary and Co- president of the Interact Club at AAE and I was given a medal for having the most volunteering hours, and a medal for good leadership.<br><br>

        I went to the University of California Riverside and I later transferred to University of California Berkeley because they have an amazing pre law program. During my years in University, I worked as an intern in a criminal defense office,I also worked as an intern to a tax lawyer. I also worked as an assistant to the mayor of my home town, Apple Valley. I was also a part of Model UN in my second year of University which gave me the opportunity to go for multiple conferences in different states like San Francisco. I was also a member of the board in ASB which stands for Associated Student Body in my last year of University. I was the president of this club and I had the opportunity to organize events and work with amazing people. I want to become a person that uses the voice to help people, to help people that have been wrongfully convicted of a crime, or people that feel that the government constantly shuts them down when they gain the courage to speak up for themselves.,In everything I do, I strive to maintain my individuality with contributing to the betterment of myself, school, and the community. I believe that we all have a responsibility to make positive change in our areas of influence, and that goes beyond having excellent test scores and GPA. I’ve chosen to be a lifelong learner who will give back to her community and the world.
